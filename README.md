## 👋 About Me

### 👨‍💻 Who I Am

I am an **Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) student** with a strong focus on  
**Embedded Systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Automation, and AI-integrated hardware solutions**.

I don’t just study concepts.  
I **design, build, test, and improve working systems** that solve real problems.

---

### ⚙️ What I Work With

- Microcontrollers: **ESP32**
- Embedded firmware development
- Sensor integration and signal handling
- Hardware–software system integration
- Automation workflows and logic design
- AI-assisted and data-driven hardware systems

I believe engineering should **work in the real world**, not just in PPTs and lab records.

---

### 🎯 What I’m Focused On

- Building **deployable embedded and IoT systems**
- Creating **smart safety, automation, and monitoring solutions**
- Exploring **AI at the edge**, not just in the cloud
- Writing clean, understandable, and reusable code
- Learning by **building → failing → fixing → improving**

## 🚀 Engineering Philosophy

> “If it doesn’t work outside the lab, it doesn’t matter.”

I value **practical engineering**, documentation, and systems that can be  
used, tested, and improved by real people.
